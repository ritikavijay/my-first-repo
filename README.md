learning to code
I have created a PDF merger desktop app using Tkinter.
steps to use this:
    Download check.py and main.py files and keep them in one folder.
    open this folder in pycharm
    Open the terminal in pycharm and install few packages as :
      pip install PyPDF2
      pip install PILlow
    or you can get these packages by selecting packages with correct versions 
    from you python packages tab
Run main.py file in pycharm 
You will get the PDF merger Window:
Type the directory path in the first field and click on submit button
All the pdf files of your directory will be displayed in the pink box
click on merge button to see the merged file location
